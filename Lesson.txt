***************************************display property***********************************
    - inline: cannot change the width of the element but can sit by other elements side --> like span, anchor tag, img
    - block: can change the element's width but cannot sit by other elements side --> like paragraph
    - inline-block: can change the width of element and sit by other elements side
    - None: it remove the element from the page totally as if it never existed(you can also change the visibility property to none,
      to hide the element as well, the difference is that, setting visibility to none just hide the element but keep it's position, but setting
      display to none remove the element from the page entirely )



**************************************position property***********************************
absolute: take out the element from the flow of the page, and remove it's gost
relative: position elements relative to it's current position, and keep the gost of it's previous location
static: keep the element in a fixed place



**************************************align elements of the page centered***********************************
method-1: this method works if all elements are either block or inline-block and none of them has a width set for it
  in body property set text-align: center;

method-2: if there is a width set for any element do this
  use margin like so: margin: 0 auto 0 auto;


  *********************************************sizing********************************************************
  >>>> intermediate css / 013 css sizing
px : is static sizing, if u set the size of, say, a paragraph to 20px, even if u change the font size of the page in your browser,
     the size of your paragraph doesn't change(not good for visually impaired people who needs it)(does not inherit from it's parent)
% : a percentage of the page(inherit from parent)
em : equals 16 px(inherit from parent)
rem(root em): it only inherit from the root , not even parent(you can sort of say it doesn't inherit from parents)***** best option to use******

--- > 1em = 16px = 100%
 some set the font size in px , that might not be good for visually impaired people, but those who use px over % or em say , visually impaired people
 mostly tend to zoom in instead of changing the font size of web page



******************************************float vs. clear*****************************************************
with great power comes great responsibility, float is one of the properties that comes with a lot of corner cases, so only use it when it is really
really necessary. and only use it for what it's meant for, which is wrapping a text around another element like an image. and don't use it for positioning
